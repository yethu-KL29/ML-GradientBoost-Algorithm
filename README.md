# Gradient Boosting Algorithm

## Description

Gradient Boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion and generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function.

This repository provides a robust implementation of the Gradient Boosting algorithm, allowing for flexible customization and easy integration into existing projects. 

## Features

- Efficient implementation of Gradient Boosting for both classification and regression tasks.
- Customizable parameters to control model complexity and performance.
- Supports various loss functions and learning rates.
- Easy integration with preprocessing pipelines and other machine learning tools.
